# Ultrafast Laser Science Data Repository

This repository provides datasets for published results in the field of ultrafast laser science, covering various wavelength regions. It serves as an open-access resource for researchers working on ultrafast laser dynamics, nonlinear optics, and related topics.

## Features:

- Experimental and numerical data from peer-reviewed publications
- Structured datasets for different wavelength regions
- Metadata and references for reproducibility
- **Examples:** Interactive graphs showcasing the data for the 1 micron and 2 micron wavelength regions are available [on our webpage](https://www.puls.ruhr-uni-bochum.de), [here](https://www.puls.ruhr-uni-bochum.de/puls/research/NIR.html.en) and [here](https://www.puls.ruhr-uni-bochum.de/puls/research/SWIR.html.en).

We encourage collaboration and contributions to expand this repository. If you use the data, please cite the corresponding publications and this repository.
